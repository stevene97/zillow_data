# Telling a story using Zillow Data

This short project aims to tell a story about trends in housing prices over time by emphasizing both changes over time on a nationwide level, as well as on a city-by-city level. By using a combination of interactive maps, line graphs, and bar graphs, this short project also aims to maximize the interactive tools that one could produce with R's Shiny, Leaflet, and ggplot2 packages.
