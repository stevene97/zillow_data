# Telling a story using Zillow Data

This short project aims to tell a story about trends in housing prices over time by emphasizing both nationwide trends as well as regional trends. By using a combination of  maps, line graphs, and histograms, this short project aims to maximize the interactive tools that one could produce with R's Shiny, Leaflet, and Plotly packages, allowing the data dashboard to pique each user's individual interests, backgrounds, and experiences.
